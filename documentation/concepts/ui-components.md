# UI Components

`ai-core` supports declarative UI components in assistant answers. The model
does not emit HTML or JavaScript. It emits a component identifier and JSON data;
the frontend renders the component from a trusted definition.

## Response format

UI blocks use a Markdown-adjacent, dedicated syntax:

```text
:::ui select-list
{"id":"products","options":[{"label":"A","value":"a"}]}
:::
```

Normal Markdown and UI blocks can be mixed in one answer. `BlockParser` parses
complete blocks and creates stable instance identifiers when no `id` is given.
Unknown or malformed blocks must not create frontend components.

## Definitions

A `Definition` contains:

- a stable `identifier`;
- a human-readable title and description;
- a frontend template;
- a data schema and allowed placeholders;
- configured actions and prompt templates;
- an optional wrapper CSS class.

Definitions are provided through `ProviderInterface`. The provider is the
configuration source, not a service registry. A CMS or another host can load
definitions from records, configuration files or code.

## Prompt instructions

`UIComponentsContextBuilder` contributes the available component definitions to
the existing central prompt-building process. It documents the component name,
purpose, schema, actions and block syntax for the current pipeline step.

Only the answer generator and quality gate should normally receive these
instructions. The quality gate may keep, remove or add valid UI blocks before
the final response is streamed.

## Actions

Interactive components submit normal user prompts through the existing chat
transport. Prompt templates are configured outside the model and may use only
allowed placeholders. The model can provide values, but cannot provide
arbitrary JavaScript, event handlers or prompt execution logic.

Navigation components use regular configured links and do not submit prompts.

## Built-in definitions

Built-in definitions live under:

```text
Assistant/UIComponents/Defaults/
```

The catalog currently includes `select-list`, `link-list`, `link`, `buttons`,
`progress-indicator` and `decorative`.
